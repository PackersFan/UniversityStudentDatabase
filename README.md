# UniversityStudentDatabase
This is a web based residence life student management system for use in universities to register students and their guests.  Final project for CSCI332 - Database Concepts, at the College of Charleston. 

Formerly hosted on Siteground, the application doesn't exactly work without being hosted. A copy of the database scripts are included, and all of the .php pages are there, but until I rehost somewhere it doesn't function.
